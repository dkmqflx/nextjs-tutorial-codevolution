## Client-side Data Fetching

- over the past several videos we learned about pre-rendering
- and the two forms of pre-rendering next js offers static generation and server-side rendering
- **Two forms of pre-rendering**
  - Static Generation & Server-side Rendering
- we also learned how to fetch data in both the forms
- we use the getStaticProps function for static generation
- and getServerSideProps function for server-side rendering
- **How to fetch data**
  - getStaticProps & getServerSideProps
- when building applications though, you might not always need to pre-render the data
- for example consider a user dashboard page
- if you are a user on a blogging page, you probably need analytics like how many posts you're published, how many likes you have on those posts, how many followers you have etc
- because such a dashboard page is private that is behind a login screen
- it is highly user specific and SEO is not relevant
- so there is no need to pre-render the data
- instead you can rely on client-side data fetching

- `/dashborad`로 접속한 후, html파일을 보면,
- we only see the loading text
- so next js did pre-render the page since that is the **default behavior**
- however the pre-rendered page is based on the initial state of that component
- in our dashboard page, isLoading is true to begin with
- which implies the loading text is what is visible
- next js doesn't wait for the api call and update this state of the component
- so the page source will always contain the loading text and the data is never pre-rendered
  - 즉, 제일 처음 isLoading이 true 이므로, 그에 해당하는 컴포넌트의 state를 Pre-render해서 보여주기 때문에, html 파일에 Loading 텍스트만 보이는 것이다
  - 그리고 새로고침 해도 이는 그대로이다
- so if you are creating a page that is private **does not need SEO** and is **user specific**, client-side data fetching is the way to go
- this is especially handy when your page is split into components and you want to fetch data from the individual components
- and render them as and when the data is fetched rather than wait for the entire page data to be loaded
- components unlike pages cannot execute getStaticProps or getServerSideProps
- and hence client-side data fetching is the only possibility
  - pages 폴더에 있지 않는 컴포넌트는 getStaticProps나 getServerSideProps을 사용할 수 없기 때문에 client side data fetching만 가능하다.
- now one last thing i would like to mention here is that i have shown you an example using the fetch api
- however you're not restricted to using this 
- you can also make use of axios or any data fetching library that you're comfortable with
- the cool thing is that the team behind, next js created a react hooks library for data fetching called swr 
- it is what the next js team recommends
