### Pre-rendering & Data Fetching Summary

- pre-rendering refers to the process of generating html in advance which results in better performance and SEO
- next js by default pre-renders every page in our application
- we then learned that next jssupports two forms of pre-rendering
  - static generation
  - server-side rendering
- static generation is a method of pre-rendering where the html pages are generated at build time
- pages can be built once cached by a cdn and served to clients almost instantly
- it is the recommended method to pre-render pages whenever possible as it is the more performant of the two forms
- an example would be a marketing site or a blogging site
- for a normal page you make use of getStaticProps function to fetch the data ahead of time
- for a dynamic page you also need the getStaticPaths function to let next js know of the possible values for the dynamic parameter to pre-render those pages
- we also learned about the fallback key its possible values of false true or blocking and how they dictate the pre-rendering behavior for dynamic pages
- one of the limitations of static generation is that the pages cannot be updated without a full rebuild to help
- in that scenario we learned about incremental static generation and the revalidate key
- the ISR strategy is suitable for perhaps a documentation site or even an e-commerce site

**Server-Side rendering**

- we then had a look at server-side rendering which is crucial if you need to fetch data at request time and also need to personalize data based on user information in the incoming request
- with ssr the data is fetched at request time, the html is then generated and sent to the browser because of which it is slower
- a possible use case of ssr is a news listing page
- we also learned about the getServerSideProps function which helps with ssr data fetching
- finally we had a look at combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching
- we learned how to use the data fetched a head of time as the initial data for the component which enables client-side data fetching as well
- we also learned about shallow routing which does not call server-side functions again but helps with sharing and bookmarking filter data and of course SEO
- with that we come to the end of this section
- pre-rendering and data fetching is one of the most important pillars of next js and i hope you now have a thorough understanding of the topic
