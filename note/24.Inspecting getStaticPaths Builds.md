- in the previous video we learned about the usage of getStaticPaths function
- in this video let's inspect the build output as well as the network tab when we run the application
- let's start with the build command in the terminal run the command yarn build
  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

λ  (Server)  server-side renders at runtime (uses getInitialProps or getServerSideProps)
○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
   (ISR)     incremental static regeneration (uses revalidate in getStaticProps)

- this takes a couple of seconds to generate the build folder
- now for the first part let's make sense of the build output in the terminal like before we have a list of all the individual pages generated
- we have the root page and the 404 page then we have the posts page which is statically generated and we know that because of the filled circle indicating SSG
- so automatic generation of html plus data as json using get static props right after `/posts` we have slash `posts/post/id`
- this again is statically generated as you can see the filled circle
- but for this route next js uses the post id returned from getStaticPaths to generate the individual pages
- through the use of getStaticPaths we inform next js that the post id can be one two or three and next js uses that information to generate /posts slash one slash two and slash three
- we also have the slash users route
- before if we inspect the `.next` folder, we can see all the generated files within server folder, within pages folder, we have posts.html and posts.json
- we also have a posts folder itself within this folder we see 1.html, 2.html, 3.html and their corresponding json files
- in case you missed it last time, let me repeat when the html and json come into play
- if you navigate directly to /posts/1 the html file is served to the browser
- however if you navigate to /posts/1 from another page using the link tag for example the json is used to preload the data into the required page

---

- if you're still confused let's run the app and inspect the network tab to get a more clear picture in the terminal run the command yarn start

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

- /posts/1 로 바로 접속하면, 1.html을 서버로 부터 받은 것을 확인할 수 있다
- document one that is loaded from the server
- the content type is text slash html and the preview is available so 1.html is the page that is served when we navigate directly to /posts/1
- this html file we see here in the server pages folder

- now let's navigate to this same page but from the post list page so navigate to localhost port 3000/posts and then empty cache and reload
- this time the document fetched is posts. html but if you observe closely we also have 1.json 2.json and 3.json fetched from the server
- next js sees that there are three links in the posts page which need additional data
- so it will fetch the necessary json a head of time
- if you now navigate to /posts/1, no additional data is required, you can see there is no activity in the network tab
- 1. json from before is used to build this page
- you're seeing in the browser this helps next js provide that performance improvement in page load time
- if you view page source the content is still present along with the json data that is needed as props for the page component
- and remember the link component prefetching doesn't just apply to pages with getStaticPaths if i navigate to the home page

- empty cache and hard reload both users.json and post.json are prefetched
- this is because a user can navigate from this page to either
- the users page or the posts page
  - root 페이지에는 user와 posts의 json 파일 밖에 없다
- and if we do navigate to /posts, then json files for post id 1 2 and 3 are prefetched
  - 그리고 posts 페이지로 이동하면 1, 2, 3 json 파일을 받는다
