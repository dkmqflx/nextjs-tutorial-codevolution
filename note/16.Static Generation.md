### Pre-rendering in Next JS

- Next JS suppors two forms of pre-rendering
  - Static Generation
  - Server-side Rendering

### Static Generation

- static generation is a method of pre-rendering where the html pages are generated at **build time**
- so the html with all the data that makes up the content of the web page is generated in advance when you build your application
- this method is also the recommended method to pre-render pages whenever possible
- because the page can be built once, cached by a cdn and served to the client almost instantly
- this as you might have guessed leads to a huge performance boost for your application
- examples for when to use static generation include Blog pages, ecommerce product pages, documentation and marketing pages

### Static Generation - How ?

- next js, by default will pre-render every page in our app
- so the html for every page will automatically be statically generated when we build our application
- this is the reason in the previous video we were able to see all the html elements when **viewing the page source**
- now i'm pretty sure you might have a question at this point in time
- “throughout this video you've been mentioning that pages are pre-generated at build time
- but there is no build for our application yet, is there ? Aren't we running the application in development mode ? “
- now this is a very good question to have in your mind but what you need to understand here is the intention
- behind a production server versus a development server,

- **Prod Server**
  - for production, an optimized build is created once and you deploy that build
  - you don't make code changes on the go, once it is deployed
  
- **Dev Server**
  - a development server on the other hand is all about the developer experience
  - we should be able to make changes in our code and we want that code to immediately reflect in the browser
  - we can't afford to build our app once, make the change, rebuild, make the change again and you get the idea
  - so here's what the next js team decided
  - for production builds a page will be pre-rendered once when we run the build command
  - however in development mode, a page will be pre-rendered for every request you make
  - so if you visit the home page, it is pre-rendered and served
    - 개발자도구 - Network의 localhost의 preview를 보면 해당 화면이 pre render 된 것을 확인할 수 있다
  - refresh the page is pre-rendered and served
  - there is no one-time pre-rendering
  - but rather pre-rendering on every request to ensure code changes are reflected on every request
  - and it might seem strange when i say this
  - but you don't worry much about static generation in development mode
  - you mainly have to understand how it works when you build your application

### Static Generation contd.

- next js by default, without any additional configuration, statically generates every page in our application when we build it for production
- this allows the page to be cached by a CDN and indexed by a search engine

- **Static Generation**

  - The HTML generated at **build-time** and is reused for each request

  1. Next.js
     - next build
     - Builds the app for production
  2. The HTML is generated
  3. Reused for each request

- for a quick summary of static generation
- the html is generated at build time and is reused for each request
- now the example we've looked at did not require fetching any external data
- but that might not be the case all the time

### Static Generation & Data

- **Static Generation without Data**
  - For pages that can be generated without fetching external data at **build time**
  1. Next.js
     - next build
     - Builds the app for production
  2. The HTML is generated - no need to fetch external data
- you might have a marketing page where all the content is already known and can be coded as part of the page itself
- the index page in our next js app is also one such example

- **Static Generation with Data**
  - however for some pages you might not be able to render the html without first fetching some external data
  - maybe you need to read some json from the file system perhaps call an external api or even query your database at build time
  1. Next.js
     - next build
     - Builds the app for production
  2. Fetching external data
     - [{img:’sdfsdf’, text:’…’}, {img:’bbbb’, text:’…’}]
  3. The HTML can only be generated after fetching data
