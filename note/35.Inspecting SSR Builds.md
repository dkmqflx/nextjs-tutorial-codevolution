- in this video let's inspect the build output from server side rendering
- before we build our app i'm going to add a log statement in index.js as well as category.js
- so pre-rendering news article list and pre-rendering news articles for category followed by the route parameter

- let me also delete the .next folder, now in the terminal run the command
- yarn build this takes a couple of seconds to generate the build folder

λ  (Server)  server-side renders at runtime (uses getInitialProps or getServerSideProps)
○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
   (ISR)     incremental static regeneration (uses revalidate in getStaticProps)
```

- now for the first part let's make sense of this build output
- like before we have a list of all the individual pages generated
- our focus though is on this news route both /news and /news/category have a lambda symbol beside them
- and if you take a look at the legend lambda stands for server-side rendering
- the next point to keep in mind is that server-side rendered pages are not statically generated at build time
- so if we inspect server pages news we don't see the html pages
- so the behavior is as expected for the final part let's start the app in the terminal run yarn start
- if we now navigate to /news, the page is pre-rendered and you can see the log statement in the terminal
  ```jsx
  Pre-rendering NewsArticleList
  ```
- navigate to /news/sports and the page is pre-rendered again at request time
  ```jsx
  Pre-rendering News Articles for category sports
  ```
- and the log statement is also present in the terminal
- pre-rendering for category sports
- but for both these pages even after the request is made, the html is not generated in the server folder
- since new pages are built at request time
  - request를 통해 이미 server 폴더에 파일이 만들어져 있다
- there is no need to generate a page into the build folder
- and if you were to change article 1 description in db.json to new description 1
- refresh you can see that it is reflected in the very next request for that page
  - 바로 반영이 된다
- now what we have just seen might seem trivial after inspecting builds for static generation
- but like i mentioned earlier building, our app and running the built app is as close as we can get to production deployment
