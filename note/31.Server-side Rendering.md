## Two forms of pre-rendering

- in the first video of this pre-rendering section i mentioned there are two forms of pre-rendering

1. static generation
2. server-side rendering

### Static Generation

- what we've learned so far is only the first form which is static generation
- as the name indicates the html is statically generated at build time
- the built page is then cached and reused for each request
- of course we do have exceptions for a dynamic page with getStaticPaths and fallback set to true the page is not generated at build time
- but is generated on the initial request
- with incremental static regeneration
- a page can be regenerated for a request after the revalidation time has elapsed
- but in both these cases, we do serve the statically generated html pages
- even if it is for a small duration of time as is the case of ISR so
- with the first form of pre-rendering for the most part pages are generated using getStaticProps when you build the project
- but in doing this we come across two problems

### Problems with Static Generation

1. **We cannot fetch data at request time**

   - the first problem is that we cannot fetch data at request time
   - with not being able to fetch data per request, we run into the problem of stale data
   - let's say we are building a news website
   - the content is very dynamic in the sense that news articles can be published almost every second
   - given the nature of the content of such a website, you simply cannot afford to have stale data
   - getStaticProps will fetch the news at build time which is not at all suitable
   - getStaticPaths will help fetch the data on the initial request but it is then cached for subsequent requests
   - that is no good either
   - incremental static regeneration can help but if revalidate is one second we still might not always see the most up-to-date news when the regeneration is happening in the background
     - 1초로 설정해도, 요청한 그 다음부터 새로운 데이터를 받을 수 있다
   - and if your intention is to revalidate less than every second for a website where a user is visiting almost every second
   - there simply is no point in having ISR
   - you would much rather fetch the data on the client side by making a get request from the component
   - however in doing so you have lost the benefits of SEO
   - and for a news publishing website SEO is of the utmost importance and simply cannot be neglected
   - so the first problem with static generation is that we cannot fetch data per request and pre-render

1. **We don’t get access to the incoming request**
   - the second problem is that we don't get access to the incoming request if the page is pre-rendered at build time
   - this becomes a problem when the data that needs to be fetched is specific to a user
   - let's say we are building a website similar to twitter
   - as a user i should be able to see tweets that are personalized based on my interests
   - however the tweets that i see also need to be SEO friendly as it is public content that anyone in the world can see by searching in google or other search engines
   - to fetch tweets specific to the user, we need the user id and that can be obtained only if we have access to the incoming request
   - for example the user id can be part of request cookies which we can extract and use to fetch data specific to that user
   - without access to the incoming request it becomes difficult to build a page similar to a twitter feed
   - you could do it client-side with useEffect for example but that means you again miss out on SEO
   - so the second problem with static generation is that we cannot fetch data that is user specific and pre-render a page
   - to overcome these problems next js offers the second form of pre-rendering which is server-side rendering

### Server-side Rendering

- with ssr nex js allows you to pre-render a page not at build time but at request time
- so the html is generated for every incoming request here
- Server-side Redering with Data

  - On each request, the data is fetched and the HTML is generated

  1. user : Page Request to → Next.js
  2. Next.js → Fetches external data [ {img:’1’, text: ‘123’}, {img:’232’, text:’231’}
  3. The HTML is generated

- a user makes a request to a page next js fetches the external data for that specific request
- generates the html and finally sends it to the browser

---

- we now understand that ssr is a form of pre-rendering where the html is generated at request time
- we also learned that ssr is required when you need to fetch data per request and also when you need to fetch personalized data
- of course keeping in mind SEO
- so we now know what is ssr and why is it required the next question is how
  - how does next js make it possible to fetch data at request time ?
  - or how does nexus make it possible to get access to the incoming request which will facilitate fetching data personalized for a user
