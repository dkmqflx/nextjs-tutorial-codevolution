### Authentification in Next.js

- when you're building an application, it typically revolves around a user
- and when we talk about a user two things come to mind
- identity and access
- identity verifies who a user is while access verifies what permissions the user has
- from an application point of view, we term this as authentication and authorization
- now next js being a full stack framework is slightly more verbose when it comes to the topic of authentication as compared to react for example
- in the react app your focus is only on authenticating the client-side code
- when you're writing a next js app though, you have to consider authentication from three perspectives
  - client-side authentication
  - server-side authentication
  - and finally api routes authentication
- how do you secure the code in all these three scenarios
- once you understand that the next thing, you might want to think about is user data
- do you need to persist user data or not
- if you're building an app where you don't really have to persist user data, you can rely on odd services like github, facebook etc to ensure the user is authenticated
- however if your app needs to persist users, you would also have to make use of a database
- and it is all these details that i've just mentioned which we will be learning in the upcoming videos
- now if you think about managing all this, writing your own code from scratch, we would probably be here for the rest of 2021
- so to make things easier, we are going to use a library called nextAuth.js
- it is a complete open source authentication solution for next js applications
- it has built-in support for many odd services like apple or xero, discord, facebook, github, twitter and plenty more
- and if you're not interested in any of those, you can have password less authentication with emails and custom username password credential authentication with support for many popular databases like mysql postgres, sql server, mongodb etc
- it exposes several methods and hooks that will make your life easier
- at this point it is the only package i would recommend you get started for authenticating a next js application
