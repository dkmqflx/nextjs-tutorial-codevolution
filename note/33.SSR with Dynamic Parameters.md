- in the previous video, we learned how to use the getServerSideProps function to server side render the news list component
- in this video let's learn how to a side render with dynamic parameters
- for our example what we want is a page that filters the news articles by category in our list of articles
- you can see that we have two articles with category sports and one article with category politics
- what we need to do is create a route `/news/category` which will display the list of articles that match the category in the url
- so in the browser, if we navigate to `/news/sports`, we should see articles one and three
- if we navigate to `/news/politics`, we should see article two

---

- if we navigate to `/news/sports`, we see articles one and three
- if we navigate to `/politic`s, we see article two
- if you inspect the network tab the, pre-rendered page is what is served to the browser
- so we have successfully server-side rendered the page with dynamic parameters
- if you are server-side rendering a list of items, it is quite common to also server side render a filtered list of items or even an individual item by its ide

```jsx
function ArticleListByCategory({ articles, category }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Showing news for category "{category}"</h1>
      {articles.map((article) => {
        return (
          <div key={article.id}>
            <h2>
              {article.id} {article.title}
            </h2>
            <p>{article.description}</p>
            <hr />
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}

export default ArticleListByCategory;

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { params } = context;
  const { category } = params;
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/news?category=${category}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      articles: data,
      category,
    },
  };
}
