### Preview Mode

- in this video let's take a look at the preview mode feature that next js offers
- now i have to mention right away that the preview mode feature is kind of built specifically to help applications that rely on a CMS
- CMS stands for content management system and is a tool that helps users create, manage and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge
- so a person from the marketing team can control what is displayed on the website without having the need to ask a developer to make a change having said that
- in this video we are not going to work with a CMS as we would need an entire hour just for that
- what we are going to learn is the preview mode feature and how it can be used when you do have a CMS
- if you worked with a CMS before, it should make sense to you
- if you haven't used a CMS before, understand what this feature is capable of doing and utilize it when you do come across such a requirement at work

### When to use Preview Mode ?

- in the pre-rendering section, we understood about static generation where the pages are pre-rendered at build time
- it is pretty useful when your pages fetch data from a CMS
- however it's not suitable when you are creating a draft version in your CMS and want to preview the draft changes immediately on your page
- you want next js to bypass static generation for this draft or preview scenario
- think about it otherwise, you deploy your app and then you make changes in your CMS but they won't be reflected as pages are only generated when you build the application
- so there was a need to handle this scenario of a “Preview of Publish” as i call it
- and you might have guessed it that is exactly the problem the preview mode feature solves

---

- i have a news folder and within the news folder `index.js` within the file we have a very simple page component that uses getStaticProps for passing in some data to the component at build time
- the data is extracted as props and rendered in the jsx for demo purpose
- data is a simple string instead of an actual array of news articles
- so if we visit `/news`, you should see the news list page nothing too special but we will build on this page in this video
- all right now let's learn how to implement the preview mode feature
  ```jsx
  function News({ data }) {
    return <h1 className="content">{data}</h1>;
  }

  export default News;

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    return {
      props: {
  **       'List of published articles',
      },
    };
  }
  ```

---

- step 1 we need to create a new file in the api folder, let's call it preview.js
- within the file we implement a basic handler function
- so export default function handler
  ```jsx
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.setPreviewData({});
    res.end('Previw mode enabled');
  }
  ```
- this function receives the request and response as parameters
- now within the function body, we call the setPreviewData method on the response object to enable preview mode
- so res.setPreviewData, the method accepts an object as an argument where you can set any key value pairs and access it within getStaticProps or getServerSidePro
- for now let's leave it in as an empty object
- i'll also end the response with the string preview mode enabled so res.end
- preview mode enabled if we now head back to the browser and navigate to `/api/preview`
- we should see the response that preview mode is enabled
- we can verify this by inspecting cookies in the dev tools
- so application cookies for localhost:3000, 아래 이름을 가지는 것을 확인할 수 있다
  - \_\_next_preview_data
  - \_\_prerender_bypass
- data cookie set which of course will be available on every request
- and this is how you enable preview mode

---

- of course we can't expect the user to hit our api and then go back to using the app
- we should be in charge of redirecting the user to the appropriate route
  ```jsx
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.setPreviewData({
      user: 'Vishwas',
    });
    res.redirect(req.query.redirect);
  }
  ```
- so instead of res.end we're going to do a res.redirect
- redirect takes in the path as its argument
- but what do we pass in as the redirect path
- well we are going to rely on the incoming request
- in an ideal scenario, when you're working with a CMS, you would configure your CMS preview button to open the app passing in a redirect query parameter which you can use as the redirect parameter in this function
- we will of course pass it in the url when typing in the browser
  - `res.redirect(req.query.redirect);`
- now we can head back to the browser clear the preview related cookies and navigate to `/api/preview?redirect=/news`
  - application - cookies 탭에서 위에서 만들어진 값들을 지우고 해당 url로 이동한다
- you can see that the preview cookies are set and we are automatically redirected to the news page
  - 다시 위에 있었던 값들이 cookie에 생기고, `/news` 페이지로 이동하게 된다
- we have the “list of published articles”
- all right now that we are redirecting to the path we want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set

---

- the second step is to update getStaticProps
- if you remember getStaticProps, receives context as its parameter
- well as it turns out when preview mode is set, context.preview will be set to true
- you can make use of the flag to fetch different data from your CMS
- in our example when setting the data, i'm going to check is it currently the preview mode

  ```jsx
  function News({ data }) {
    return <h1 className="content">{data}</h1>;
  }

  export default News;

  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    return {
      props: {
        data: context.preview ? 'List of draft articles' : 'List of published articles',
      },
    };
  }
  ```

- if we head back to the browser and refresh
- we now see the “list of draft articles “being displayed
- but the main point is that getStaticProps will run on **every request** instead of running only during build time
- and to see that in action we need to build our application as running it in dev mode has no difference
- so let's add a console.log statement to getStaticProps
  ```jsx
  function News({ data }) {
    return <h1 className="content">{data}</h1>;
  }

  export default News;

  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    console.log('Running getStaticProps', context.previewData);
    return {
      props: {
        data: context.preview ? 'List of draft articles' : 'List of published articles',
      },
    };
  }
  ```

- running getStaticProps in the terminal
- run yarn build and we see the log statement from getStaticProps after building let's start the application using yarn start
  ```jsx

  λ  (Server)  server-side renders at runtime (uses getInitialProps or getServerSideProps)
  ○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
  ●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
  ```
- in the browser clear the preview cookies and refresh
- we should once again see the list of published articles
- if you take a look at the terminal though, we don't see any log statement from getStaticProps
- refresh again and no log statement
- 새로고침해도 아무런 로그 찍히지 않는다

---

- let's now enable preview mode
- so in the browser navigate to `/api/preview?redirect=/news`
- the cookies are now set and we see the “list of draft articles” being displayed
- take a look at the terminal and we see the log statement running get static props
  ```jsx
  Running getStaticProps { user: 'Vishwas' }
  ```
- refresh again and we see another locg statement

  ```jsx
  Running getStaticProps { user: 'Vishwas' }
  ```

- so only when preview mode is enabled getStaticProps will run on every request
- even after the application has been built and deployed
- what this allows is for you to constantly make updates in your CMS
- and immediately view those changes in the browser as you don't have to rebuild the entire application
- hopefully you're able to realize the power of the preview mode feature

---

- alright now for step 3 we need a way to disable the preview mode
- you can't expect a marketing team user to open dev tools and clear the preview mode cookies
- to help us out, next js provides the clear previewdata method on the response object
- let's understand how to make that work
- in the api folder, create another file disable-preview.js

  ```jsx
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.clearPreviewData(); //  this disables the preview mode
    res.end('Preview mode disabled');
  }
  ```

- we can now restart our dev server

  ```jsx
  yarn dev
  ```

- navigate to `/api/preview?redirect=/news`
- and the cookies are set and we are redirected where we see “the list of draft articles”
- now we can navigate to `/api/disable-preview`, and we see the response preview mode disabled
- we can verify that by noticing the absence of the cookies
  - cookie에 있던 것들 사라져 있다
- of course you would need some sort of a ui to help the marketing team navigate to this route and then redirect to the home page possibly

---

- but that is something you can figure out based on the app you're building and the CMS you're using
- now the last point i would like to bring to your attention is about the preview mode data that you can set
- remember the argument we passed to setPreviewData
  ```jsx
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.setPreviewData({
      user: 'Vishwas',
    });
    res.redirect(req.query.redirect);
  }
  ```
- well let's add a key user and set it to the string vishwas
- we can access this in getStaticProps
- using context.preview data
- enable preview mode using setPreviewData and disable it using clearPreviewData
- if you have any data that you want to set as part of preview mode you can access it using context.previewData
- inside getStaticProps or getServerSideProps like i mentioned before
- the preview mode is a really important feature when you have a CMS as part of your application
