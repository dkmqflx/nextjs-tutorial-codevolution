### Pre-rendring + Client Side Data Fetching

- now for the last bit of discussion around client-side data fetching
- i want to show you how to combine it with pre rendering
- for our example we're going to look at building an event listing page basically
- **Event Listing Page**
  - a page that shows a list of events happening around you
  - since we want SEO and the list of events be fetched at request time
  - we're going to use server side rendering with getServerSideProps function
  - once events have been loaded, we're going to use client-side data fetching to filter the events
  - now ideally both pagination and filtering would take place client-side
  - but for this example we're only going to focus on filtering
  - back in vs code we are again going to make use of json server for some mock data
  - in db.json i've created an entry called events which is an array with 10 objects
  - each event has an id title description category and date for our example we're going to fetch this list of 10 events
  - and then client-side, we're going to filter only the events with a category of sports 
  - not the most practical data to work with but it will serve the purpose

- 코드 작성 후, `yarn dev`
  ```jsx
  function EventList({ eventList }) {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>List of events</h1>
        {eventList.map((event) => {
          return (
            <div key={event.id}>
              <h2>
                {event.id} {event.title} {event.date} | {event.category}
              </h2>
              <p>{event.description}</p>
              <hr />
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </>
    );
  }

  export default EventList;

  export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/events?${queryString}`);
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      props: {
        eventList: data,
      },
    };
  }
  ```
- and navigate to `localhost:3000/events`, we should see the list of 10 events being displayed
- inspect the network tab and the html is in fact pre-rendered so nothing new here
- server side rendering with getServerSideProps
  -  getServerSideProps 때문에 pre-rendered된 html 파일들이 있다.
  -  getServerSideProps은 request time에 pre render 하기 때문에, html 파일의 preview 탭을 보면 정상적으로 데이터가 다 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다.

- but after we have rendered the list, we want to allow the user to filter the events based on the category
- now ideally we would have a side nav with a list of all categories that the user can select to filter the events
- but to keep this simple, i'm going to add one button that will filter events with sports category
- the aim here is to help you understand combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching and not topics that are more react-specific

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function EventList({ eventList }) {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState(eventList);

  const fetchSportsEvents = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4000/events?category=sports');
    const data = await response.json();
    setEvents(data);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={fetchSportsEvents}>Sports Events</button>
      <h1>List of events</h1>
      {events.map((event) => {
        return (
          <div key={event.id}>
            <h2>
              {event.id} {event.title} {event.date} | {event.category}
            </h2>
            <p>{event.description}</p>
            <hr />
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}

export default EventList;

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/events?${queryString}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      eventList: data,
    },
  };
```

- we now go back to the browser, refresh we have a list of 10 events
- if i click on sports events, we now see only four events with category is equal to sports
- and this as you can see happens client-side
- so we have pre-fetched 10 events for **SEO purpose** but then the filtered data fetching takes place **client-side** on click of a button
- but at the moment, if i want to share this list of filtered events with a friend or if i want to bookmark this filtered list of events, it is not possible
- the url is the same for filtered list as well as the entire list of events
- we can however improve this by making use of shallow routing
- with shallow routing, you can update the url in the browser without running the code inside getServerSideProps
- for that we need to make a couple of changes

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function EventList({ eventList }) {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState(eventList);
  const router = useRouter();

  const fetchSportsEvents = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4000/events?category=sports');
    const data = await response.json();
    setEvents(data);
    router.push('/events?category=sports', undefined, { shallow: true });
    // Shallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching methods again, that includes
    // https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/shallow-routing
  };
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={fetchSportsEvents}>Sports Events</button>
      <h1>List of events</h1>
      {events.map((event) => {
        return (
          <div key={event.id}>
            <h2>
              {event.id} {event.title} {event.date} | {event.category}
            </h2>
            <p>{event.description}</p>
            <hr />
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}

export default EventList;

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { query } = context;
  const { category } = query;
  const queryString = category ? 'category=sports' : '';
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/events?${queryString}`);
  const data = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      eventList: data,
    },
  };
}
```

- let's now save the file and test it out on page load of `/events`
- we have the list of 10 events pre-rendered
- if i now click on the sports events button, we filter the events client side
- but the url is now updated as you can see
  - 즉, 제일 처음 버튼을 누르면 data를 fetching해서 해당 데이터를 기반으로 페이지를 렌더링 해준다 
  - 다만 이 때는 html파일을 다시 받는 것이 아닌데. 그 이유는 `{shallow :  true}` 때문이다
- and because of this if we now refresh and inspect the document that is downloaded 
- we see only the list of four filtered sports events
  - 하지만 다시 새로고침을 하면, html 파일 보면 4개의 리스트만 있는 것 볼 수 있다
- this means i can now share this url with anyone and they would see the list i am seeing
- it also helps with SEO
- what is happening is when we reload the page getServerSideProps is run and now it sees the category query parameter is present
  - 새로고침하면 getServerSideProps가 실행되기 때문에 이 때, params로 전달된 context에서 query 를 받아서 fetching 하기 때문에 html 파일을 새로 받는 다운 받는 것을 확인할 수 있다.
- if it is present the url, fetches the filtered events and passes it into the component as data and this data is used in our state variable which is used to render the list of events
- as you can see it is pretty easy to combine pre-rendering with client-side data fetching
- also this example uses getServerSideProps function but the idea remains the same for getStaticProps as well

---

- now at this point i know you might have a few questions in mind
- let me try and answer those questions
- your first question might be about the filtering function itself
- hey you have fetched all the events in getServerSideProps
- so in your fetch sports events function, why don't you simply make use of array.filter to filter the events client side
- now that is a good question to have
- but array.filter would only work if we are assuming our entire list of events is fetched at once
- i have fetched all 10 events because it is a very small number
- in a real-world application you might have 1000 or 10000 events
-  in such a scenario, you would be fetching the first 100 events on the initial load
- when you have fetched only the first 100 events if you were to use array.filter, you would be filtering events out of those 100 events and not the entire 10000 events in your database
- you would probably have api pagination and filtering in which case you would need to make api requests every time to fetch the filtered list of events
- that is the reason i decided to make an api call in the fetch sports events function

---

- the second question you might have is probably the more important one here
- hey why are you using query parameters to add filters instead of making use of dynamic pages where the dynamic segment can be a category
- you could then make use of context.params and regular routing to achieve the same result
- let me tell you this is an excellent question to have thought about
- the answer is yes you could do that
- you can create an events folder with index.js as the root page and then a catch-all route to handle filters as part of the url itself
- so if a user would apply let's say two filters the url could be `/events/filter1/filter2`.
- you can extract both these filters and pre-render the data
- however this becomes a problem when you have a lot more filters to work with
- consider a site like amazon where you have a side nav with 10 to 20 filters for a product
- in such a scenario extracting the filters and mapping the value to the filter type is very very difficult and probably not even feasible
- imagine a url like /product/filter1/filter2/filter3… filter10
- keeping track that f1 is for brand f2 is for price f3 is for color and so on just becomes very difficult to manage
- the easier way to do all that is to use shallow routing with client-side filtering
- now if this was a bit difficult to wrap your head around at the moment
- please don't worry about it
- once you start working on real projects, you will soon figure out what is feasible and what is not 
- when you do that you can re visit this video to understand better the concept of pre-rendering combined with client-side data fetching and shallow routing
