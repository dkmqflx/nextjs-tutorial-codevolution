### Authentication Section Intro

- we're going to take a look at authentication index shares
- first we're going to understand what exactly does authentication entail when it comes to next.js
- after that we will take a look at the next auth library which at the moment is probably the best way to handle authentication in an next js application
- there are various ways to authenticate
- but for our example, we will take a look at authenticating with just github
- you should be able to use that knowledge to work with other providers like gmail facebook or even email authentication with your credentials
- we will also see how to handle sign in, sign out and securing the application
- last but not the least, we will see how to work with a database like mongodb as part of authenticating our application
