### Authentification Summary

- in this video i want to quickly summarize what we have learned in the authentication section
- we started off by understanding what authentication entails in next js application
- we learned about the next auth package which is the go to solution for authentication in next js
- we learned how to configure the next auth library in our application using the catch-all route and github as an auth provider
- once we had the library configured, we learned how to sign in and sign out we then moved on to understanding client-side authentication using the useSession hook
- and securing pages client-side using the getSession function
- after that we learned about the next auth provider which improves performance reduces network calls and avoids page flicker when rendering
- we then learned about server-side authentication with the getSession function in getServerSideProps
- we also secured pages server side by redirecting from getServerSIdeProps
- we learned that the same getSession function can be used for authenticating api routes as well
- towards the end, we learned how to connect to a database like mongodb to persist user data
- finally we learned about callbacks which let you customize the session object that is available for use in your application
