### getStaticProps

1. getStaticProps runs only on the server side

   - and this is the reason when we console log the data we see it in the terminal as a post to the browser console (그래서 브라우저 콘솔에서 안보였던 것)
   - which also implies that the function will never run client-side
   - as a matter of fact the code you write inside getStaticProps won't even be included in the js bundle that is sent to the browser

1. you can write server side code directly in getStaticProps

   - so code that you would typically see in node.js like accessing the file system using the fs module or querying a database can all be done inside getstatic props
   - and if you were to import, let's say the fs module to read from the file system, the code for fs module also will not be bundled as part of the code sent to the browser
   - next js is pretty smart when it comes to that
   - you also don't have to worry about including api keys in getStaticProps as that won't make it to the browser either

1. getStaticProps function is allowed only in a page and cannot be run from a regular component file

   - it is used only for pre-rendering and not client-side data fetching
   - in our example from the previous video, we can define getStaticProps in any file in the pages folder but not in the components folder

1. getStaticProps should return an object and the object should contain a props key which is in turn an object

   - otherwise next js will throw an error
   - in our example we returned an object and the object contained a props key which was an object as well

1. getStaticProps will run at build time
   - however during development that is when you run `yarn dev` in the terminal getStaticProps runs on every request you're changing the code almost every minute
   - and it's only logical that next js has to run the function on every request
   - so there is a slight difference in dev and prod
   - but speaking of production we haven't quite run the build command so far in this course have we
   - so in the next video let's build our next js application which will also give us an insight into how pre-rendering with static generation works at build time
