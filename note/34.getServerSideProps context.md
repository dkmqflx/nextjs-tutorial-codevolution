- in the first video on server side rendering i mentioned that one of the limitations of static generation is that you don't get access to the incoming request that prevents you from fetching data that is user specific
- getServerSideProps on the other hand, does give you access to the incoming request
- in this video let's briefly take a look at the different objects that you can access from this context argument

- the first two objects are request and response
- so in our getServerSideProps function, from context we can destructure request and response now i would log both these to the console
- but the objects contain a whole load of properties and methods 
- so i'm going to point you to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) for getServerSideProps where they mention that request is a standard http incoming object and response is a standard http response object
- The context parameter is an object containing the following keys:
  - params: If this page uses a dynamic route, params contains the route parameters. If the page name is [id].js , then params will look like { id: ... }.
  - **req**: The HTTP IncomingMessage object, with an additional cookies prop, which is an object with string keys mapping to string values of cookies.
  - **res**: The HTTP response object.
  - query: An object representing the query string.
  - preview: preview is true if the page is in the Preview Mode and false otherwise.
  - previewData: The preview data set by setPreviewData.
  - resolvedUrl: A normalized version of the request URL that strips the _next/data prefix for client transitions and includes original query values.
  - locale contains the active locale (if enabled).
  - locales contains all supported locales (if enabled).
  - defaultLocale contains the configured default locale (if enabled).

- if you've worked with express.js before, this should be very familiar to you
- for our example i'll demo how to set and read cookies from the request and response to get the cookies from the request
- we access `req.headers.cookie`, so console.log `req.headers.cookie` and to set a cookie, we're going to specify `res.setHeader` the first argument is
  ```jsx
  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', ['name=Vishwas']);
  console.log(req.headers.cookie);
  ```
- now the response from this page is always the component that is defined above
- however you can modify the response like modifying the header to set cookies
- alright let's now test this to see if it works

- in the browser i'm going to open the application tab, and the cookies panel
- at the moment we don't have any cookies, if i refresh this page though, a cookie is set with key is equal to name and the value vishwas
- this is what we have mentioned in getServerSideProps
- if you take a look at the terminal, though, the cookies are undefined
- that is because the initial request did in fact have no cookies
  ```jsx
  undefined;
  ```
- but now that we have set a cookie ourselves on that initial request
- if i refresh again you should see the cookie logged in the terminal name is equal to vishwas
  ```jsx
  undefined;
  name = Vishwas;
  ```
- now based on your requirement you could perhaps set a user identification token which can then be used to fetch data specific to that user
- what you want to do with the request and response object is completely up to you
- i just wanted to show you how to get hold of them in getServerSideProps

- now another object that might come in handy is the query object which gives you access to the query string
- let's destructure it from context and log the value to the console
  ```jsx
  export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const { params, req, res, query } = context;
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', ['name=Vishwas']);
    console.log(req.headers.cookie);
    console.log(query);

    const { category } = params;
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/news?category=${category}`);
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      props: {
        articles: data,
        category,
      },
    };
  }


  ```
- if you now simply refresh the page, you can see the query object contains the route parameter which is category
- but this of course can be extracted from params
  ```jsx
  // /news/politics
  
  {
    category: 'politics';
  }
  ```

- however if we have a query string in the url
- for example question mark subcategory is equal to football and category is sports
- you can see that can be accessed using the query object we have subcategory as well as category

  ```jsx
    // /news/sports?subcategory=football

  { subcategory: 'football', category: 'sports' }
  ```

- query strings are quite common when you have to filter a client site and ensure the urls can be shared with others
- an example would be the amazon products url after you've applied some filters
- you're going to see query parameters in the url but you want the link to be shared with someone else
