- in the first video on server side rendering i mentioned that one of the limitations of static generation is that you don't get access to the incoming request that prevents you from fetching data that is user specific
- get server side props on the other hand, does give you access to the incoming request
- in this video let's briefly take a look at the different objects that you can access from this context argument

- the first two objects are request and response
- so in our getServerSideProps function
- from context we can destructure request and response now i would log both these to the console
- but the objects contain a whole load of properties and methods so i'm going to point you to the documentation for getServerSideProps where they mention that request is a

standard http incoming object and response is a standard http response object

- if you click on the links, you'll get to learn about the different properties and methods
  - 공식 documentaion link
- if you've worked with express.js before, this should be very familiar to you
- for our example i'll demo how to set and read cookies from the request and response to get the cookies from the request
- we access request.headers.cookie, so console.log request.headers.cookie and to set a cookie we're going to specify res.set header the first argument is
  ```jsx
  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', ['name=Vishwas']);
  console.log(req.headers.cookie);
  ```
- now the response from this page is always the component that is defined above
- however you can modify the response like modifying the header to set cookies
- alright let's now test this to see if it works

- in the browser i'm going to open the application tab, and the cookies panel
- at the moment we don't have any cookies, if i refresh this page though, a cookie is set with key is equal to name and the value vishwas
- this is what we have mentioned in getServerSideProps
- if you take a look at the terminal, though, the cookies are undefined
- that is because the initial request did in fact have no cookies
- but now that we have set a cookie ourselves on that initial request
- if i refresh again you should see the cookie logged in the terminal name is equal to vishwas
  ```jsx
  undefined;
  name = Vishwas;
  ```
- now based on your requirement you could perhaps set a user identification token which can then be used to fetch data specific to that user
- what you want to do with the request and response object is completely up to you
- i just wanted to show you how to get hold of them in getServerSideProps

- now another object that might come in handy is the query object which gives you access to the query string
- let's destructure it from context and log the value to the console
- if you now simply refresh the page, you can see the query object contains the route parameter which is category
- but this of course can be extracted from params

  ```jsx
  {
    category: 'politics';
  }
  ```

- however if we have a query string in the url
- for example question mark subcategory is equal to football and category is sports
- you can see that can be accessed using the query object we have subcategory as well as category

  ```jsx
  { subcategory: 'football', category: 'sports' }
  ```

- query strings are quite common when you have to filter a client site and ensure the urls can be shared with others
- an example would be the amazon products url after you've applied some filters
- you're going to see query parameters in the url but you want the link to be shared with someone else
