### getStaticPaths fallback : ‘blocking’

- before i dive into the points let me tell you that fallback blocking is very similar to fallback set to true
- the only difference is that instead of showing a fallback page, you'll not see any new content in the ui while the page is being generated on the server
- but to ensure we understand it correctly let me walk you through the different points how fallback set to blocking affects pre-rendering

1. the first point remains the same as fallback set to false or true, the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to html at build time by getStaticProps
2. however the second point differs the parts that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. instead on the first request next js will render the page on the server and return the generated html
3. when that's done the browser receives the html for the generated path. from the user's perspective it will transition from the browser is requesting the page to the full page is loaded there is no flash of loading or fallback state
4. at the same time next js keeps track of the new list of pre-rendered pages subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time

  ```jsx
  yarn build

  yarn start
  ```

- when the build completes if you take a look at server pages posts pages for post id 1 2 and 3 are statically generated as they are returned from getStaticPaths
- next let's start the application so in the terminal run the command yarn start
- in the browser what i want you to observe is sort of the load time for each of the pages
- let's load  `/post/2`.
- when i load the page the time taken is 6 milliseconds if i navigate to slash 3 the time taken is 8 milliseconds
- so pretty fast as the pages are already pre-rendered
- however if i navigate to  `/post/4` you can see the time taken is 600 milliseconds which is considerably higher compared to the previous loads
- so what is happening here is when you make the initial request to `/4`, next js will start to render the page on the server for post id equal to 4.
- during this time the tab shows a loading spinner indicating that a request is being made
  - 브라우저의 탭에서 로딩 스피너가 보인다
- after the page has completed rendering on the server, the browser receives it
- and because of the blocking behavior, the first request itself has the content returned
  - 즉, `fallback:true`는 처음 요청 후, html 파일을 보면 IsFallback 으로 반환된 텍스트가 보이고, 이후 새로고침을 했을 때 제대로된 정보가 보이지만
  -  여기서는 모든 정보가 제대로 보인다 
- there is no flash or loading state between the request and the page load
- just a small delay
- also you can see here in the terminal getStaticProps is called
- so we see the log statement generating page for /post/4
- and the page for post id equal to 4 is also generated in the build folder
- so pretty much the same as the previous video but instead of rendering a fallback page, the ui is blocked till the new page is received in the browser

---

- when ?
  - on a user experience level sometimes people prefer the page to be loaded without a loading indicator if the wait time is a few milliseconds. this helps avoid the layout shift that some users are not a fan of
  - but the technical reason blocking was introduced is because some crawlers did not support javascript. the loading page would be rendered and then the full page would be loaded which was causing a problem
  - so nextjs team recommends fallback set to true unless you see a problem with it in which case you can use fallback set to blocking
