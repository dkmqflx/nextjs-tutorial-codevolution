- in the previous video, we tried to implement static generation using getStaticProps for a page with dynamic route parameter
- when we navigated to the page, though we were presented with an error getStaticPath is required for dynamic SSG pages and is missing for `/post/postId`
- so next js is basically telling us we need to implement getStaticPath whatever that might be to get rid of this error
- but what exactly is getStaticPath and why do we need it to fix this error

- let me explain that first for our example we are asking next js to pre-render or statically generate the html for a route which contains a dynamic parameter
- post id you can see the same here in vs code
- however we also need to consider the fact that a dynamic parameter indicates we won't be having one single page

- we would have multiple pages for different values of post id the html for the page would remain the same
- but the data would differ for every postId
- so next js is telling us hey the post id can be 1 2 3 or even 1 million i have no clue what possible values the post id parameter can accept
- so i need you as the developer to tell me what post ids i need to consider when generating the pages at build time
- if you don't, i'm going to throw an error that you have not specified
- the path parameter for pre-rendering this page which is exactly what has happened in our case
- we have asked next js to pre-render this post id page
- but we haven't informed what are the possible values of post id and the way we inform that is using this getStaticPath function
