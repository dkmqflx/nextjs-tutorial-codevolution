### Static Generation & Issue

- static generation is a method of pre-rendering where the html pages are generated at **build time**
- the pre-rendered static pages can be pushed to a CDN, cached and served to clients across the globe almost instantly
- static content is fast and better for SEO as they are immediately indexed by search engines
- Static generation with getStaticProps for data fetching and getStaticPaths for dynamic pages seems like a really good approach to a wide variety of applications in production

- Issue
  1. the build time is proportional to the number of pages in the application
  2. a page, once generated, can contain stale data till the time you rebuild the application

---

### Issue with build time

- the build time is proportional to the number of pages in the application
- **Example Scenario**
  - let's assume a page takes 100 milliseconds to build
  - if we have a small ecommerce app with around 100 different products
  - to build the app we would need 10 seconds
  - seems reasonable but if you have a very successful ecommerce app you might have several thousands of products
  - for 100 000 products at 100 milliseconds per page you need slightly over two and a half hours to build your app for production which is quite a bit of time if you think about it
  - keep in mind it's not just the time, but there are cost implications as well
  - this problem of large build times only gets worse with more products you add to the system as every new page increases the overall build time

### Issue with stale data

- now you might argue that you will build your app only once in a while
- but if you do that depending on the nature of your application you might run into the issue of stale data
- for example, an ecommerce app is not an application which you can build and deploy once in a while.
- product details especially product prices can vary every day
- and you cannot sit back relax and build your application once in a while
- if you want the latest data in the product pages, you have to rebuild the app and in doing so we stumble into the first issue again
- imagine if for a sale the price of a product is changed from one thousand dollars to nine hundred dollars, the entire app has to be rebuilt and the page with the updated data will be statically generated
- even for one small change you have to rebuild the app and if you have to wait ours together to get a change across to production to ensure there is no stale data displayed to the user
- it is definitely a problem that needs attention

### What about getStaticPaths ?

- now you might be thinking hey you explained about getStaticPaths which will help us
- pre-render only few pages at build time and rest of the pages can be pre-rendered on request
- can we not use that to render say 1000 most popular pages and rest of the 99 000 pages can be generated on request
- well we can't do that because getStaticPaths works only with dynamic pages
- if your application has 90 percent static pages and 10 percent dynamic pages, getStaticPaths will not help much
- however we are a bit lucky with regards to that because an ecommerce site typically will have 90 percent dynamic pages and 10 percent static pages
- so we can reduce the total build time by using getStathPaths
- however it still does not fix the issue of stale data
- if you render 1000 pages at build time, and the rest are generated based on incoming request using fallback true or fallback blocking, changes in data will not update the already pre-rendered pages
- so even if you change the product price after a page has been generated, the same page is served for subsequent requests
- and this is a problem i want to help you understand with an example as it is really important for building optimized next js applications

---

```jsx
npm i json-server
```

- why did i do this instead of reusing jsonplace holder api well that is because for this particular example i need the api data to change over time
- which is not possible with json placeholder
- with json server though, we are in control of the data we serve at any given time

---

- the problem is that of stale data where the external data has changed but the pages do not update to reflect the change
- let's see that in action by building and running our application

  ```jsx
  // .next 폴더 삭제

  yarn build

  yarn start
  ```

- once the build completes you can see that in the build folder within server pages we have products.html which corresponds to the product list page in index.js
- and within the products folder we have 1.html and 1.json statically generated at build time which correspond to product id.js
- of course with product id being equal to 1
- in the browser if we now navigate to `/products`, we see the list of three products id title and price
- if i navigate to `products/1`, we get the details of the first product
- but here lies the problem in our db.json file
- let's update the price for product one let's make it 900 from 1000.
- if we now go back to the browser and refresh the page the price is still 1000.
- same is the case with the products page as well (`/products`)
- it still shows 1000.
- if we query our db.json directly though, you can see the product price has indeed changed 900
  - 하지만 db server 주소인 lcoalhost:4000로 접근하면 900으로 변경된 것 확인할 수 있다
- so our app is now serving stale data

- but hang on other product pages have not been generated at build time
- that is product two and product three so we should not face this issue with those pages
- well let's take a look
- i'm going to change product to price from 2000 to 1500
- perhaps if we now go back to our api refresh, product two price is 1500 as expected
- we go back to our app though refresh the product list page still serves stale data and that is sort of expected
- since it was generated at build time
- however if i navigate to `/products/2`, to our surprise we see the price is 1500
- since product id 2 was not returned from getStaticPaths, this page is pre-rendered on initial request or statically generated on the initial request and because of that we don't see the stale data here
- at the moment our product list page shows 2000 as the price whereas the detail page shows 1500 as the price
- now you might think this is the only problem we have at the moment
- but i'm afraid that's not the case back in db.json
- if i further decrease the price from 1500 to 1000 product 2
- and refresh the api you can see the price has updated
  - db server 주소인 lcoalhost:4000로 접근하면 1000으로 변경된 것 확인할 수 있다
- if i refresh the details page though, you can see that the price remains 1500 the data is stale yet again
- and this is because this page has been statically generated
- after the initial request any subsequent requests will serve the already generated and cached page
- and that is the page where price was set to 1500
- as you can see this is a problem which can't be ignored

### Incremental Static Regeneration

- so there was a need to update only those pages which needed a change without having
- to rebuild the entire app to solve that problem next js introduced the concept of **incremental static regeneration(ISR)**
- with isr next js allows you to update static pages after you've built your application
- which means you can statically generate individual pages without needing to rebuild the entire site, effectively solving the issue of dealing with stale data
- so we now know what is incremental static regeneration and what problem it solves
- the next question is how do we make use of it in our application
- as it turns out next js makes it really simple

- How ?
  - in the getStaticProps function apart from the props key we can specify a revalidate key
  - the value for revalidate is the number of seconds after which a page regeneration can occur
