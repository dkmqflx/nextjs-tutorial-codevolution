- in this video we're going to understand how to configure redirects in our application
- redirects are useful when you're reorganizing your website and the urls have changed or perhaps the site is undergoing maintenance and you want to temporarily redirect users to a different page
- with next js, configuring redirects using the configuration file is very simple

---

- for step one in next.config.js, we're going to add a key called redirects this is an async function

  ```jsx
  /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
  const nextConfig = {
    reactStrictMode: true,
    redirects: async () => {
      return [
        {
          source: '/about',
          destination: '/',
          permanent: true,
        },
      ];
    },
  };

  module.exports = nextConfig;
  ```

- from the function, we return an array of objects
- each object in the array corresponds to a redirect
- for our example let's add a redirection from the about page to the home page
- for that we specify three properties in the object
- the first one is source
- this will be our `/about` route
- next we specify the destination which is the home route
- finally we set a property permanent to true
- this property indicates whether the redirection is temporary or permanent
- and that is pretty much it

---

- let's now restart the server and head to the browser so `yarn dev`
- and i'm going to open the network tab as it is important to make note of the status code as well
- let's now navigate to `localhost:3000/about`
- when we do that we are automatically redirected to the home page
- and if you observe the network request we have a status code of 308, permanent redirect

  - about html 파일 확인해보면 308 Status code를 확인할 수 있다

- a permanent redirect is applicable when you're reorganizing the routes in your application
- for example `/old-blog/path` can become `/new-blog/path`
- however for a user who has bookmarked the old page, the old path might not work anymore
- by using redirects you're forwarding them to the new path
- and this is crucial for SEO as well
- since the redirection happens on the server there's no flash of content in the ui and the user experience is not compromised

---

- now you can also set permanent to false
  ```jsx
  /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
  const nextConfig = {
    reactStrictMode: true,
    redirects: async () => {
      return [
        {
          source: '/about',
          destination: '/',
          permanent: false,
        },
      ];
    },
  };

  module.exports = nextConfig;
  ```
- restart the server, empty cache and hard reload
- and navigate to `/about`
- this time we see a 307 temporary redirect
- we are basically informing that the page is temporarily redirected
- for example due to maintenance
- the path should work as expected in the near future
- now 307 or 308 doesn't really matter for a user but for search engines and crawlers the status is pretty important
- i would recommend you take a look at http redirects to learn more about the topic

---

- so this is pretty much the basics of redirection in next js
- now there is a lot more redirection than this basic example we have just seen
- you could perhaps want dynamic parameters in your path matching
- so let me paste another object corresponding to a redirect
- you can see here id from the old blog route matches with the id in the new blog route
- apart from this there is wildcard path matching regex path matching
- matching by extracting header information like cookies query parameters and a lot more
- the usage depends on the need for your application
- so i will stop here to avoid making it complicated than it should be please do have a look at the next js
- documentation though whenever you come across the need to write complex path matching redirects
  ```jsx
  /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
  const nextConfig = {
    reactStrictMode: true,
    redirects: async () => {
      return [
        {
          source: '/about',
          destination: '/',
          permanent: false,
        },
        {
          source: '/old-blog/:id',
          destination: '/new-blog:id',
          permanent: true,
        },
      ];
    },
  };

  module.exports = nextConfig;
  ```
