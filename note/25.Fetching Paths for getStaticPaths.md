- in the previous few videos, we learned about the getStaticPaths function which is used to inform mixtures of the different values to support when statically generating a dynamic page
- however for our understanding of getStaticPaths, i have restricted the total number of posts to 3 in post.js
- this also helped me hard code a list of three objects in the paths array in postId.js
- now we can all agree this is not going to work in a practical real world application for starters
- we don't want just the three posts to be shown the api sends 100 posts and we want all 100 posts to be displayed in our post list component
- and as far as getStaticPaths is concerned, the paths should be fetched dynamically and not hard-coded

- 코드 수정 한 후,
  ```
  yarn build
  
  yarn start
  ```
- if we run the yarn build command, you can see that it is generating 105 pages
- and if we inspect the `.next` folder, server pages posts, we should have 100 html and json files
- the static generation is successful
- 즉, 이 방법은 100개의 page를 미리 모두 만들어주는 방법이다.
