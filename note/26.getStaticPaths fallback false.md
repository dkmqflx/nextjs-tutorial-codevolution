### getStaticPaths and fallback

- fallback : false
- fallback : true
- fallback : ‘blocking’

- the first thing to note about the fallback key is that it is mandatory that is the reason we had to include it two videos ago
- the fallback key accepts three possible values false true and blocking when it comes to performance and user experience understanding the behavior of static

generation for each of these values is really important and that is exactly what we are going to do in this video

### getStaticPaths fallback : false

1. when fallback is set to false the first point is that the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to html at build time by getStaticPaths
2. the second point is that if fallback is set to false, then any path not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page

- .next 폴더 삭제
- yarn build
- yarn start

1. when fallback is set to false the first point is that the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to html at build time by getStaticPaths

   - in post id.js from getStaticPaths, we return three paths where post id is one two and three
   - if we expand the .next folder / server pages / posts folder, we see 1.html 2.html and 3.html which are the files generated for post id one two and three
   - of course the json files are also present for client-side navigation
   - so that covers the first point now for

1. the second point is that if fallback is set to false, then any path not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page
   - in the browser if i navigate to /posts/1, we see the post details if i navigate to /three we see the post details
   - but if i navigate to /4, we get the 404 page and this is due to the fact that getStaticPaths only returns post id one two and three
   - so if i may repeat, if fallback is set to false then any path not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page

- When ?
- the false value is most suitable if you have an application with a small number of parts to pre-render
- new pages are not added often
- a blog site with a few articles is a good example for fallback set to false
  - each blog post would be statically generated at build time which helps with faster load times and seo
