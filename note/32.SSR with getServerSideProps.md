- if you now save the file and take a look at the browser
- we should see the list of three news articles being displayed
- so what is happening here is that when we navigate to /news, the next js server receives the request
- upon receiving the request next js runs the getServerSide props function exported from the page the data is fetched and provided as props to the component
- the html for the component is generated on the server and then sent back to the browser
- so if we inspect the news document in the network tab you can see that the html is already generated
- and then sent to the browser so we are able to successfully pre-render the news page
- one point you have to keep in mind is that this form of pre-rendering is slower compared to static generation as the server must compute the result on every request
- because of this slower performance, use server-side rendering only if absolutely necessary
- now before we wind up this video i want to quickly highlight a few points about get server side props

---

### getServerSideProps

- a lot of it will seem familiar since we have already been through getStaticProps
- but i want to repeat for completeness

1.  - the first point is that getServerSideProps runs only on the server's side which also implies that the function will never run client-side
    - as a matter of fact the code you write inside getSideServerProps won't even be included in the js bundle that is sent to the browser
    - this leads us to our second point

1.  - you can write server side code directly in getServerSideProps
    - so code that you would typically see in node.js like accessing the file system using the fs module or querying a database can all be done inside getServerSideProps
    - and if you were to import, let's say the fs module to read from the file system, the code for fs module will also not be bundled as part of the code sent to the browser
    - next js is pretty smart when it comes to that
    - you also don't have to worry about including api keys in getServerSideProps as that won't make it to the browser either the

3 .

- third point is an important one as well get server side props function is allowed only in a page and cannot be run from a regular component
- it is used only for free and not client-side data fetching

4.

- the fourth point is that getServerSideProps should return an object and the object should contain a props key
- which is again an object otherwise next js will throw an error the exception
- of course is when you return not found

1.  - the fifth and final point is that getServerSIdeProps will run at request time
