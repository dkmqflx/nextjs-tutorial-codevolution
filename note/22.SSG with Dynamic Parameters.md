### Master-Detail Pattern

- it's also called the list detail pattern
- in this pattern you have a master page which displays a list of items and a details page which shows the relevant information of a selected item in the master page
- for example you can consider a blogging site when a user lands on your home page they are presented with a list of all your blog articles
- when they click on one of the articles, they are navigated to a page where the actual article content is present
- the scenario with next js sorting is very simple to implement
- we can add a slash blog route that renders a list of articles and we can add a slash blog blog id which renders the individual article details
  - Master
    - Blog Home Page
    - `/blog`
  - Detail
    - Article Content
    - `/blog/blogId`
- but staying in line with our topic of discussion
- we want both these routes to be pre-rendered
- we've already learned the benefits of pre-rendering pages
- so it is quite natural we want the feature in our blogging site as well
- but we do have something different from what we have seen earlier
- which is the **dynamic id** parameter for each blog post
- so let's now learn how to statically generate pages with dynamic parameters

- now for our external data we are once again going to rely on json placeholder
- if you scroll down to routes, the top two routes are exactly what we need for our example
- we have a slash posts route which returns an array of 100 posts
- we also have slash posts slash post id which returns the data corresponding to one single post
- we can use slash posts for the master page and slash posts slash post id
- for the detail page now i understand
- it's not blog data which was the case in our slide
- but this serves the purpose now i'm going to break this video down into two parts
- first part we're going to implement the slash posts master page using get static props
