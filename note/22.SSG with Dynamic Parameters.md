### Master-Detail Pattern

- it's also called the list detail pattern
- in this pattern you have a master page which displays a list of items and a details page which shows the relevant information of a selected item in the master page
- for example you can consider a blogging site when a user lands on your home page, they are presented with a list of all your blog articles
- when they click on one of the articles, they are navigated to a page where the actual article content is present
- the scenario with next js sorting is very simple to implement
- we can add a  `/blog` route that renders a list of articles and we can add a  `/blog/blogId` which renders the individual article details
  - Master
    - Blog Home Page
    - `/blog`
  - Detail
    - Article Content
    - `/blog/blogId`
- but staying in line with our topic of discussion
- we want both these routes to be **pre-rendered**
- we've already learned the benefits of pre-rendering pages
- so it is quite natural we want the feature in our blogging site as well
- but we do have something different from what we have seen earlier
- which is the **dynamic id** parameter for each blog post
- so let's now learn how to statically generate pages with **dynamic parameters**

- we have a `/posts` route which returns an array of 100 posts
- we also have  `/posts/postId` which returns the data corresponding to one single post
- we can use `/posts` for the master page and `/posts/postId`
