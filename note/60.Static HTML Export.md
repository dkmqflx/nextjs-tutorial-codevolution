### Next build, start and export

- in this video let's take a look at exporting our next js application to static html
- before we take a look at the code though, let's learn a few things about building an next js application
- next build
  - earlier in the series we have learned about the next build command which builds the application for production in the `.next` folder
  
- next start
  - in order to run the application though, we had to use the next start command
  - the command starts a node.js server that supports hybrid pages serving both statically generated and server side rendered pages
  
- next export
  - well let me tell you there is a third command related to the build process
  - and that is the next export command which exports all your pages to static html files that you can serve without the need of a node.js server
  - similar to what create react app does
- this allows you to host your app on any static hosting service or a CDN without having to maintain a server
- but it comes with its own limitations the important one being you cannot use ISR or server side rendering
- what you have to keep in mind though, is that statically generated pages using `next export` are still reactive
- so you can rely on client-side data fetching for dynamic content
- now what is a good example for using `next export` , landing pages blogs and any application where the content is generated pretty much at build time are all very good candidates for `next export`
- if your pages are rendered dynamically at runtime though, you should use `next start` to run your application
- with these points in mind let's try to export the app we've built so far in this miscellaneous section

---

```jsx
// package.json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "export": "next build && next export",
    "serve-json": "json-server --watch db.json --port 4000"
  },
```

```jsx
yarn export
```

- run the command `yarn export` when we run the script you can see that we encounter an error 
  - `image optimization using next js default loader is not compatible with next export`
- so as it stands we cannot use the image component for optimization
- we already see a limitation
- of course we can solve this by hosting the app on vercel and probably using one of these possible solutions
- but that is not what we want right now
- so to fix this in pets.js let's remove the image component

- with that fixed let's rerun the `yarn expor`t command
- we once again come across an error this time error 
  - for `page/blog/[blogId]` pages with getServerSideProps cannot be exported
- so it's telling us that we simply cannot use getServerSideProps
- let's try to replace it with getStaticProps

- not because it is the solution but simply because this is an example and i want you to understand what happens
- so getStaticProps and now let's rerun the `yarn export` command
- unfortunately for us, we again have an error though, getStaticPaths is required for dynamic SSG pages and is missing for blogId
- so next js is basically asking us to specify the blogId so that the html can be generated only for those pages
- let's save the file and rerun yarn export
- we have come across an error yet again found pages with fallback enabled pages 
- with fallback enabled in getStaticPaths cannot be exported
- so next js is telling us hey you can't ask me to export html pages and tell me that blogId can be anything you want to
- please mark it as false

---

- let's change fallback to false and run the command one more time `yarn export`
- finally our command succeeded
- you can see that the files have been written to a folder called out in the project root
  ```jsx
  Export successful. Files written to /Users/kimdohyun/develop/nextjs-tutorial-codevolution/out
  ```
- if we inspect this folder we can see all the html and the public resources necessary to run the application
- of course with all the limitations we have just encountered
- so that is about the `next expor`t command to export the application into static html and run it without the need of a node server
