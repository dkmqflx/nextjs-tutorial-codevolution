- all right the last topic of discussion for this section is environment variables
- most of the apps you deploy to production would typically require environment variables
- they allow you to specify different values based on the environment like development or testing or production
- and they allow you to safeguard your secrets by not bundling them into the code that is shipped to the browser
- next js being the awesome framework that it is comes with built-in support for environment variables
- let's understand how to work with them in this video to work with environment variables we need to create a new file in the project root folder
- the file name has to be .env.local
  ```jsx
  DB_USER = Vish;
  DB_PASSWORD = Password;
  ```

---

- the file is automatically get ignored
- within the file we can define the environment variables as key value pairs
- let's take a look at an example where we need to connect to a database so we can define DB_USER is equal to Vish
- and DB_PASSWORD is equal to password
- now that we have defined the variables, we can access them in our code
- for example let's say in our blogId page
- we need to connect to the database inside getServerSideProps
  ```jsx
  import Head from 'next/head';

  // dynamic title and description
  function Blog({ title, description }) {
    return (
      <>
        <Head>
          <title>{title}</title>
          <meta name="description" content={description} />
        </Head>
        <h1 className="content">Article</h1>
      </>
    );
  }

  export default Blog;

  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {
      paths: [{ params: { blogId: '1' } }],
      fallback: false,
    };
  }

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const user = process.env.DB_USER;
    const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
    console.log(`Connecting to database with username ${user} and password ${password}`);
    return {
      props: {
        title: 'Article Title',
        description: 'Article description',
      },
    };
  }
  ```
- for which we need the username and password to access the environment variable
- we use process.env
- so const user is equal to process.env.DB_USER
- and const password is equal to process.env.DB_PASSWORD
- DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD refer to keys in our .env.local file
- also please make a note that you cannot use object destructuring with process .env
- all right now that we have the variables
- let's simply log them to the console to see if the values are populated
- if we now save the file and restart our server
  ```jsx
  yarn dev
  ```

---

- head to `localhost:3000/blog/1`, we should see the values being logged in the terminal
  ```jsx
  Connecting to database with username Vish and password Password
  ```
- connecting to database with user name vish and password password
- so in this way you can maintain your application secrets in a .env file
- this file is never committed to source control
- and what you do have to know though is, by default all environment variables loaded through the .env.local file are only available in the node.js environment
- meaning they won't be exposed to the browser
- so in the component jsx if we try to render the values environment

  ```jsx
  import Head from 'next/head';

  // dynamic title and description
  function Blog({ title, description }) {
    return (
      <>
        <Head>
          <title>{title}</title>
          <meta name="description" content={description} />
        </Head>
        <h1 className="content">
          Env User {process.env.DB_USER} Password {process.env.DB_PASSWORD} Analytics{' '}
        </h1>
      </>
    );
  }

  export default Blog;

  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {
      paths: [{ params: { blogId: '1' } }],
      fallback: false,
    };
  }

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const user = process.env.DB_USER;
    const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
    console.log(`Connecting to database with username ${user} and password ${password}`);
    return {
      props: {
        title: 'Article Title',
        description: 'Article description',
      },
    };
  }
  ```

- and head to the browser you can see that the values are not rendered
- this is because next js wants to ensure you are not accidentally exposing secrets in the browser
- if you do want to expose environment variables, you have to prefix the variable with next underscore public
- for example let's say you need to expose an id for your analytics key
- you need to define next `NEXT_PUBLIC`
  ```jsx
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID = 123;
  ```

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

// dynamic title and description
function Blog({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={description} />
      </Head>
      <h1 className="content">
        Env User {process.env.DB_USER} Password {process.env.DB_PASSWORD} Analytics{' '}
        {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID}
      </h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default Blog;

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [{ params: { blogId: '1' } }],
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const user = process.env.DB_USER;
  const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
  console.log(`Connecting to database with username ${user} and password ${password}`);
  return {
    props: {
      title: 'Article Title',
      description: 'Article description',
    },
  };
}
```

- if we now restart the server, we see the value of the environment variable 123

---

- so to summarize, `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefix is mandatory if you want to access the variable inside the component
- if you only need the variable service side for example inside getStaticProps or get server side props or even api routes,
- you can simply omit the prefix and access using process.env
- environment variables are typically used to set base urls to api endpoints
- secrets like api keys or even environment dependent keys like google analytics key for example
- you should have an understanding of how to do that in next js
