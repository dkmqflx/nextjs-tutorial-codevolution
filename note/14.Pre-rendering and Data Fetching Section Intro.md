## Pre-rendering & Data Fetching Intro

- we are going to understand what exactly is pre-rendering and why would you want that in a production application

### Types of pre-rendering

1. Static Generation
   - without data
   - with data
     - when dealing with pre-rendering you may have to fetch external data so we will look at static generation without any data and static generation with data
     - next we will understand the first type of pre-rendering supported which is static generation
   - Incremental Static Generation
     - we will then take a look at a special case of static generation which is incremental static generation
   - dynamic parameters when fetching data
     - after that we will understand how to work with dynamic parameters when fetching data all of this will give you a very good idea about static generation
2. Server-side Rendering

- data fetching

### Client-side data fetching

### Combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching
