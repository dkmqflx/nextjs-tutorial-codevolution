- in this video let's run our build application and understand a few more points about pre-rendering with static generation
- in the previous video we built our application using the build npm script (`yarn build') which resulted in the `.next` folder being created with all the necessary files
- now to serve our app from this .next folder we need to run the start script
- so in the terminal run the command `yarn start`
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```
- this runs our built app on [localhost](http://localhost) port 3000

- in the browser i'm going to open the network tab and click on empty cache and hat reload (새로고침)
- you can see the various resources that are downloaded

- the first resource to inspect is this local host
- you can see the type is document which implies an html page has been returned from the server
- and that is the index.html file from the server pages folder(`.next/server/pages`)
- if you select localhost and click on preview, you can see the preview of the html page
- in the response, you can see the html code
- some of the other resources downloaded include css code, webpack code, framework code, react code, a chunk related to index.js file and some helper javascript files
- everything you need to render the `index.js` page in our application

- what i do want to point out though is the fact that code related to `users.js` file is not downloaded
- back in vs code within the `static/chunks/pages` folder we do see users chunks
- but they're not downloaded when you visit the home page(index page)
- because next js knows that there is simply no way for the user to navigate to the user's page from the index page
- of course you can navigate to users directly from the address bar
- so `localhost 3000/users` and now you can see the document downloaded is the `users.html` page in the server folder
- and for the client-side javascript, the user's chunk is downloaded

- so if we navigate to the root of our website the index page and its chunks are downloaded
- if you navigate to `/users` from the url, the user's page and its chunks are downloaded
- i want you to remember this before we proceed to the next point which is probably the main takeaway from this video

### Link 태그를 사용해서 Navigate 하기

- back in vs code in the index page i'm going to add a link to the users page so at the top
- we're going to add a link to the users

  ```jsx
  // index.js

  import Link from 'next/link';

  function Home() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Next JS pre-rendering</h1>
        <Link href="/users">
          <a>Users</a>
        </Link>
      </>
    );
  }

  export default Home;
  ```

- in the terminal i'm going to rebuild our app with the `yarn build` command once the build completes run `yarn start`

  ```bash
  yarn build

  yarn start
  ```

- if you now navigate to `/users` in the browser, resources downloaded remain the same we have users.html and the user's chunk file
- however let's navigate to the root so `localhost:3000` and i'm going to empty cache and hard reload
- on page load we see the user's link nothing too fancy in the ui but it does have an effect in the network tab
- the html page downloaded is still the index.js page of our application
- however you can now see that the `users.json` file and a `users chunk` is downloaded as well
- the advantage of this is that when we do navigate to user's route from the link, the ui is rendered instantaneously without having to fetch any additional resources from the server
- so if i clear the network tab and go to users, you can see there is no network request
  - `/users` 로 이동해서 네트워크 탭에서 다운로드 받는 것이 없다
- and this is the default behavior in next js

### Link Pre-fetching

- any `<Link/>` component in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data) for pages using static generation
- this is how the page load time is faster
- but i'm guessing you now have a very important question in your mind
- isn't static generation, generation of html in advance
- shouldn't the `users.html` file be downloaded when we navigate to `/users` from our link in the home page
- well the answer is **no** 
- if we go back to vs code and take a look at users.html in the `server/pages` folder, you can see the page has all the necessary html including the json data
  - 이미 해당 페이지에 모든 json data를 가지고 있다.
- but this page is only served when you directly navigate to `/users` from the address bar
  - `/users` 로 바로 이동하는 경우에만 `user.html` 파일이 다운로드 받아진다.
- so back in the browser if we navigate to `/users` empty cache and reload
- you can see that the document downloaded is the `users.html` file
- however if we navigate to the root empty cache and hard reload and navigate to `/users` from a different route
- only the json file along with the javascript chunk is prefetched
  - `/users`로 가기전에 미리 받아져 파일들이 미리 받아져 있다
- **these files are then used to build this ui client side and this is the most important point to keep in mind**
  - `Link`태그가 있는 경우에는 root page에서 이미 users의 ui를 구성하기 위한 json과 javascript chunck file들이 미리 받아져 있기 때문에 
  - /users로 `Link` 태그를 눌러 이동하더라도 `users.html` 파일을 다운로드 받지 않는 것이다 
  - 즉, 해당 Link에 접속할 때 필요한 html, json, js 파일들이 `server/pages` 폴더에 모두 받아져 있기 때문에, Link 태그로 이동하는 경우에는 추가적인 데이터를 받지 않고, url을 통해서 바로 해당 Link로 접속하는 경우에만 html 파일을 다운 받는다.

### Link Pre-fetching contd.

- when a page with getStatiProps is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page html file, next js generates a json file holding the result of running getStaticProps
  - json 파일을 만들어준다 
- the json file will be used in client-side routing through `next/link` or `next/router`
- when you navigate to a page that's pre-rendered using getStatiProps next js fetches the json file(pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props to create the page component client-side
- this means that client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported json is used

---

### Static Generation Summary so far

- static generation is a method of pre-rendering where the html pages are generated at build time
- static generation can be done with and without external data
- to use external data, getStaticProps function has to be exported from the page html 
- javascript and a json file containing the external data are generated and here is the important bit
- if you navigate directly to the page route, the html file is served
- if you navigate to the page route from a different route, the page is created client-side using the javascript and json pre-fetched from the server
- there is no additional request to the server
