### Traditional React App

- 개발자도구 - element 탭을보면 `<div id=”root”>` 부분을 포함해서 자식 태그로 `header` , `img`, `a` 태그 등이 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다
- 하지만, 개발자도구 - 페이지 소스보기에서 확인해보면 `<div id=”root”> </div>` 태그만 있고 이전의 element 탭에서 확인할 수 있던 태그들이 보이지 않는다.
- 이것이 전통적인 리액트 앱이 동작하는 방법이다.

### Next.js App

- 개발자도구 - element 탭을보면 `<div id=”__next ”>` 부분을 포함해서 자식 태그로 `h1` ,`p` 태그 등이 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다
- 또한, 개발자도구 - 페이지 소스보기에서 확인해보면 `<div id=”root”> </div>` 태그만에 이전의 element 탭에서 확인할 수 있던 태그들 또한 확인할 수 있다.
- 이것이 전통적인 리액트 앱과 next.js 앱이 동작하는 방법의 차이점이다.

## Pre-rendering

- React vs Next JS
  - By default, Next JS pre-renders every page in the application
- What does pre-render mean ?
  - Next Js generates HTML for each page in advance instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript

### Pre-rendering contd.

- **No Pre-rendering (Plain React.js app)**

  1. Initial Load : App is rendered
  2. JS loads
  3. Hydration : React components are initialized and App becomes interactive

  - In a react app the javascript is loaded which then executes to mount the html elements onto the dom
  - so when the page is served, we just have a div tag with id equal to root
  - once the javascript for the page is loaded, it will execute in the browser, create the different dom nodes and mount them onto the root div element
  - this process is also called hydration

- **Pre-rendering (Using Next.js)**
  1. initial Load: Pre-rendered HTML is displayed
  2. JS loads
  3. Hydration : React components are initialized and App becomes interactive
     - if your app has interactive components like <Link/>, they’ll be active after JS loads
  - In next js app, the pages are pre-rendered or in simpler words the html is already generated with the necessary data and then sent to the browser
  - the javascript would then load and make the page interactive but the html is there to begin with
  - Pre-render just means render in advance of sending it to the browser
  - pre-rendering is done by default in the next js app

### Why pre-render ?

1. Pre-rendering improves performance
   - in a react app you need to wait for the javascript to be executed
   - which would then perhaps fetch data from an external api and finally render the ui
   - so there is a wait time for the user who can to a certain extent be pacified by showing a loading indicator
   - with a pre-rendered page though, the html is already generated and hence loads faster
   - so pre-rendering can lead to better performance
   
2. Pre-rendering helps with SEO
  - if you're building an application that is behind a login screen, search engine optimization might not be a concern to you
  - however if you're building a blog or an ecommerce site
  - it is very important that search engines can index your content with a react app
  - if the search engine hits your page it only sees a div tag with id equal to root 
  - if it hits a pre-rendered page though, all the content is present in the source code which will help index that page leading to better search rankings
  - now google did improve crawling pages where the content is dynamically populated like in the case of a react app
  - but it's not the same as crawling a page where the content is already present
  - so if SEO is of concern for your app, pre-rendering is definitely what you want

### Pre-rendering Summary

- To summarize pre-rendering refers to the process of generating html in advance with the necessary data for a page in our application
- pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO
