### API Routes Section Summary

- in next js we started off by understanding that api routing mechanism is similar to page-based routing mechanism
- we learned that apis are associated with a route based on their file name
- every api route exports a default function typically named as **handler function**
- the handler function receives the request and response as parameters
- we then saw how to cater to different request types like GET and POST using `request.method`
- we also learned about dynamic api routes catch-all api routes and also how to handle a delete request
- finally we learned that **we should not call our own api routes for pre-rendering content as it just induces a delay**
- hopefully you're now in a position to build full stack production-ready applications with next js
- with that we come to the end of the api routes section of this series
- we have now covered the three core features of next js
- routing, pre-rendering and api routes but we are not quite done there are still small but important sections we need to learn about
