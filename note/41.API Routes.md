### API Routes

- next js is a full stack framework
- you can write the front-end code in react and also write apis that can be called by the front-end code
- api routes allow you to create restful endpoints as part of your next js application folder structure
- within the pages folder you need to create a folder called api
- and within that api folder you can define all the apis for your application
- you can add business logic without needing to write any additional custom server code and without having to configure any api routes
- next js gives you everything you need to write full stack react + node applications
- so next jsnot only simplifies the frontend but also the back end what more can we ask as developers all right

---

- the folder name has to be api and it has to be within the pages folder
- within the folder we can create a file with any name which will be automatically mapped to /api and treated as an api endpoint
- instead of a page let's look at an example
- i'm going to create a new file called index.js
- for this api route to work we need to export a function as default and the convention is to call that function as handler since it handles the incoming request
- so export default function handler this function automatically receives two parameters req and res short for request and response
- both these are standard node.js objects which we also had looked at when dealing with the context parameter in getServerSideProps function
- you can read more about them in the documentation
- for our simple api we are going to respond with some json data so within the function body
  ```jsx
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ name: 'Home API route' });
  }
  ```
- we pass in an object which has a name property set to home api route here .status is a function to set the status code
- and .json is a function that sends a json response and that is pretty much our api route
- we can now start our app with yarn dev
- and in the browser navigate to [localhost](http://localhost)/api we should get back the json response home api route our first api with next js is working as expected

  ```jsx
  {"name":"Home API route"}
  ```

- this is pretty much the gist of api routes
- create files within the pages slash api folder and they are automatically mapped to api endpoints
- and the mapping is similar to routing with pages that we had to look at in the first section
- but let me create a few more api routes to help you recollect
- within the api folder if we create a new file called dashboard.js and copy paste the handler function with name set to dashboard api route
- in the browser we can navigate to /api/dashboard, and we get the expected respons
- we can also create nested folders so in the api folder create a new folder called blog if you now create index.js
- within the block folder with a similar handler blog api route we can access this api by navigating to /api blog
- and if you were to create another file within the blog folder let's say recent.js
- with name being recent blog api, we can navigate to slash api /blog/resent and we get the expected response
- as you can see the api routes feature, makes it very simple to create apis without having to add any custom server setup code or route configuration for new projects
- you can build your entire api with api routes
- you may want to perhaps access an external api and mask that in point or even use environment variables to secure accessing external services
- and the best thing is that the code we write in the apis folder is never bundled with the front-end code
- you don't have to worry about your api code slowing down the react app you ship to the browser

---

- so to summarize in next js, you're allowed to create apis within the same project folder
- the convention we have to follow is to create an api folder within the pages folder and define the files which automatically get mapped to a url
- each api file must default export a function that handles the incoming request and sends an appropriate response
- the handler receives the request and responds as parameters to help us serve the data we want to send to the client
