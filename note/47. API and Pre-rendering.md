- i want to quickly discuss about apis and pre-rendering
- at the moment we are fetching a list of comments on a button click and displaying it in the browser
- now let's say you need to pre-render an individual comment in a details page
- for example if we were to navigate to /comments/1, we should see a page with the first comment pre-rendered
- if we were to navigate to /2, we should see the second comment pre-rendered
- a straightforward scenario let's see how we would go about implementing it in the pages folder within the comments folder
- we would create a dynamic page route
- within square brackets comment id and the extension is .js within the file we would implement a react component to display the data implement the getStaticPaths function to let next js know of the possible comment ids to pre-render and finally we would implement the getStaticProps function to pass props into the component
- now each of these parts we have had a look at in the previous videos
  ```jsx
  import { comments } from '../../data/comments';

  function Comment({ comment }) {
    return (
      <div>
        {comment.id}. {comment.text}
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default Comment;

  export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    const { params } = context;
    const { commentId } = params;

    const comment = comments.find((comment) => comment.id === parseInt(commentId));
    console.log(comment);

    /** Don't do this 
    const response = await fetch(`http:localhost:3000/api/comments/${commentId}`)
    const data = await response.json()
    */

    return {
      props: {
        comment,
      },
    };
  }

  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    return {
      paths: [{ params: { commentId: '1' } }, { params: { commentId: '2' } }, { params: { commentId: '3' } }],
      fallback: false,
    };
  }
  ```

- for step one i want you to code a component which will accept an individual comment as prop and render the comment id and text in the browser
- as you can see we have a function comment which accepts a comment prop and its id and text are rendered
- we also default export the component
- now for step 2 i want you to code the getStaticPaths function it is an async function which returns an object with the paths property
- the paths property is an array of objects where each object has a params property which in turn is an object with the dynamic parameter
- the returned object should also contain a fallback key set to false
- so getStaticPaths returns an object with a paths property which is an array and each object has a params key where we set comment id to 1 2 and 3.
- the values should also be string we also set fallback to false if you missed something make sure to fix your code
- now for the third and final step, i want you to implement the getStaticProps function
- it is an async function which returns an object that must have a props key
- for our scenario, i want you to use the context parameter extract the comment id get the comment corresponding to that comment id and then pass it as props to the comment component

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const { params } = context;
  const { commentId } = params;

  const comment = comments.find((comment) => comment.id === parseInt(commentId));
  console.log(comment);

  /** Don't do this 
  const response = await fetch(`http:localhost:3000/api/comments/${commentId}`)
  const data = await response.json()
  */

  return {
    props: {
      comment,
    },
  };
}
```

- you might be thinking hey we have created an api route that accepts a comment id and returns the corresponding comment
- let me just call that api and return the response as props from the function
- now if you did try this you might have run into a problem with the fetch api
- you probably need something like use swr hook
- but that is not the point i want to highlight
- what i want to highlight is the fact that you're advised not to call your own api route from within getStaticProps or getServerSideProps
- you can call an external api but calling your own api route isn't recommended
- calling it via a url introduces an additional round trip which is just not necessary
- you already have the data available
- so you can instead replicate the same logic within getStaticProps itself
- so you can see that i have imported the comments array and used it within getStaticProps to find the comment whose id matches the comment id from the url segment
- the exact same logic we had in our api
  - /api/comments/[comment].js
- once i have the comment, i return it as props for use in the component
- this code which will avoid the round trip of making a request will easily save you at least 100 milliseconds
- now i understand that we have duplicated the logic of finding a comment by comment id
- in a practical application you should extract reusable code into a separate file
- export it and then import it for use within the api route as well as within the page

---

- i have not done that to keep the code as simple as possible
- but what you should keep in mind is that you should not call an api route for free rendering
