### getStaticPaths fallback : true

1. the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to html at build time by get static props this is the same as fallback set to false so there is nothing new here
2. the paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page instead next years will serve a fallback version of that page on the first request to such a path
3. in the background, next js will statically generate the requested path html and json. this includes running getStaticProps
4. when that's done, the browser receives the json for the generated path. this will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. from the user's perspective the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page
5. at the same time next js keeps track of the new list of pre-rendered pages. subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page just like other pages pre-rendered at build time

### 1. the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to html at build time by get static props this is the same as fallback set to false so there is nothing new here

- 코드 변경후 yarn build
- in the build logs, we can see the log statement from getStaticProps generating page for slash pose slash one slash two and slash three
- if we inspect the build folder, which is the dot next folder, go to server pages / posts we see the html and json generated for post id 1 2 and 3.
- these are the post ids returned from getStaticPaths

---

### 2. the paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page instead next years will serve a fallback version of that page on the first request to such a path

- when we navigate to different pages from the url
- first we have slash posts slash one when i navigate the post details are present
- we don't see this loading text in the ui
- let me reload so you get another chance to observe refresh no loading text but we directly see the post details and this is the same with slash post slash 2 and also slash 3.
- however it is not the same when we navigate to slash pose slash 4
- which is why i want you to observe even more closer the next few seconds you're going to see the loading text appear for a fraction of a second and the post details are rendered
- and cannot refresh the same page so for path with post id 4 the loading text was displayed on the first request
  - 오직 처음 데이터를 받아올 때만 보여지고 새로고침 하면 보이지 않는다
- you can see that the parts that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page
- supposed id 4 was not generated at build time however when we navigated to slash pose slash 4 the 404 page was not shown
- instead a fallback version of the page was shown in our example the fallback version of the page is the loading text
- which is why we see the loading text on the initial request to the page hopefully point two makes sense now

---

### 3. in the background, next js will statically generate the requested path html and json. this includes running getStaticProps

- if we take a look at the terminal in vs code you can see the console log statement from getStaticProps generating page for slash posts slash 4
  ```bash
  Generating pages for /posts/4
  ```
- and if we take a look at server pages / posts, we now have 4.html and 4.json
- so when you make an initial request to a path not returned by getStaticPaths which is post id equals 4 in our case
- the getStaticProps function is run and the html as well as json are statically generated in the background
- this is what point 3 conveys to us

---

### 4. when that's done, the browser receives the json for the generated path. this will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. from the user's perspective the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page

- when background static generation is done, the browser receives the json for the generated path
- navigate to the network tab and now enter slash post slash five
- you can see five dot json is fetched in the browser
- this json will be used to automatically render the page with the required props
- from the user's perspective the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page so as soon as the json is downloaded
- next js automatically uses it to provide the necessary props for the page component
- isFallback will also be set to false and the full page jsx is rendered in the browser and it is because of this switch from a fallback page to the full page that we need to handle the condition where props are not yet available in the component
- so if fallback is set to true, it means that nexus is generating the html and json in the background and the props or the post in our case is not yet available which means we can't access id title or body
- if fallback is false however the props are available and can be used in the jsx
- this is what point number four states
- once the json is received in the browser next js will swap from the fallback page to the full page

---

### 5. at the same time next js keeps track of the new list of pre-rendered pages. subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page just like other pages pre-rendered at build time

- this is a really important one in the network tab
- if you inspect the document served when we navigate to slash post slash five you can see it is an html document
- but if you preview it is actually the loading text
- so the very first request to a path not returned by getStachPaths will always return the fallback page
  - preview 보면 Loading 텍스트만 있는데 그 이유는 4, 5 같은 경우는 getStachPaths에서 path가 return 되지 않았기 때문이다.
- however the full page is pre-rendered in the background which will be used for any subsequent requests
- so if i just refresh the page without emptying cache, you can see the html returned from the server
- now contains the full page content
  - 하지만 한번 해당 페이지에서, 새로고침한 후에 preview를 보면 Loading 텍스트 대신 정상적인 텍스트가 보이는 것을 확인할 수 있다
- this is the gist of point number five

---

- let me repeat the points by navigating to one more page to help you cement the fallback true behavior
- with fallback true only the paths returned from getStaticPaths are pre-rendered at build time
- so html and json for post id 1, 2, and 3 are generated
- if we navigate to a path not returned from getStaticPaths for example `/post/6` , a 404 page is not returned
- instead a fallback ui is presented and in the background, the page is statically generated
- at the moment we are using loading text as the fallback ui
- but you can include a well designed loading indicator while this fallback ui is being displayed in the background getStaticProps is called with the appropriate post id
- and the html and json files are generated in the build folder
- so 6.html and 6.json
- the first request to this new path will load the fallback page
- subsequent request though, will load the full page
- this is the behavior when fallback is set to true
- now you might have a question what if the user makes a request to slash post 101
- our post ids range from 1 to 100.
- there is nothing returned for post id 101
- well a possible solution is to return a 404 page
- and next js makes it really simple to do that
- in getStaticProps if you are not happy with the response, we can return an object with a not found property set to true
- and if that is the case next js will automatically render the 404 page
- for our post id page the api is supposed to respond with an object that contains a post id, title and body
- so we can make a check to see if the data object contains an id and if it doesn't return an object with not found set to true
- so if not [data.id](http://data.id/) we return an object with not found

  ```jsx
  if (!data.id) {
      return {
        notFound: true,
      };
  ```

- delete .next folder and rebuild the app

  ```bash
  yarn build

  yarn start
  ```

- in the browser if we navigate to slash posts slash one it works fine
- slash 100 we see the loading text and then the post details
- if we navigate to 101 though, we see the loading text but now the 404 page is rendered in the browser
- so with not found set to true the page will return a 404 page

---

- now another point i would like to highlight is the link component prefetching
- if we load all the 100 posts and navigate to the post detail page
  ```jsx
  // posts/index.js

  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    const data = await response.json();
    return {
      props: {
        posts: data,
      },
    };
  }
  ```
- the loading fallback ui is not shown since the html and json for a link component is prefetched
- let me show what i mean by that in the post list component which is index.js i'm going to return all the 100 posts instead of just the first three from get static parts though
- we will still return only three pages to be pre-rendered

  ```jsx
  // posts/[postId].js

  export async function getStaticPaths() {
    // const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
    // const data = await response.json();

    // const paths = data.map((post) => {
    //   return {
    //     params: {
    //       postId: `${post.id}`,
    //     },
    //   };
    // });

    return {
      paths: [
        {
          params: { postId: '1' },
        },
        {
          params: { postId: '2' },
        },
        {
          params: { postId: '3' },
        },
      ],
      // paths,
      fallback: true,
    };
  }
  ```

- when i now run yarn build the three pages are generated in the server pages posts folder

```jsx
yarn build

Generating pages for /posts/1
Generating pages for /posts/3
Generating pages for /posts/2
```

- if we start the app so yarn start and navigate to slash hosts which renders the post list component, you can see in the network tab the json data for 10 files have been pre-fetched and the same are available in the server pages folder
  ```jsx
  yarn start
  // server/pages/folders 보면 post가 더 많이 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다
  ```
- because of this even when we navigate to post id 4, we don't see the loading text fallback since there is no new data to be fetched
- this is also the reason i have been directly navigating to the page instead of navigating through the link component
- what you also have to keep in mind is that by default any link component that is in the viewport initially or through scroll will be preloaded
- so if i scroll, you can see a lot more json files being fetched and html generated
  - server/pages/posts에서 html 파일 수가 늘어나는 것을 확인할 수 있다
- when you're testing this fallback set to true, make sure you've made a note of all these situations to avoid any confusion

### getStaticPaths fallback : true

- when ?
  - the true value is suitable if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data
  - for example a large ecommerce site
  - you want all the product pages to be pre-rendered but if you have a few thousand products, build can take a really long time
  - instead you may statically generate a small subset of products that are popular and use fallback set to true for the rest
  - when someone makes a request to a page that's not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator
  - shortly after getStaticProps finishes and the page will be pre-rendered with the requested data
  - from then onwards, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page
  - this ensures that users always have a good experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of static generation
