## Routing with Pages

### Scenario 6

- in this video we are going to learn another concept with respect to the writing feature which is catch all routes
- to understand the concept let's consider scenario 6
- let's assume we are building a documentation site for a project that we have created
- we have a couple of features and each feature has a few concepts to be explained to the audience
- so let's assume our site nav looks like thisure
  - `localhost:3000/docs/feature/concept1`
  - Feature 1
    - Concept 1
    - Concept 2
    - Concept 3
    - Concept 4
  - Feature 2
  - Feature 3
  - Feature 4
  - → Docs for F1 C1
- we have five features and the first feature is expanded to show five concepts
- what we want to achieve is a unique route for each concept in a feature so
  - `localhost port 3000/docs/feature1/concept1`
  - `localhost port 3000/docs/feature1/concept2`
  - `localhost port 3000/docs/feature2/concept1`
  - `localhost port 3000/docs/feature2/concept2`
- a documentation site might have 20 features
- and each feature might have 20 concepts
- this leads to a massive 400 routes for our application
- and now that you know next js has file system based routing mechanism 400 routes corresponds to 400 files in our project
- but of course we can make use of dynamic routing
- if we replace the concept file with a concept id dynamic route file in each feature folder we would be down to 20 files
- this looks much better
  - 20 Features x 1 [concpetId] = 20
- and if you replace the feature folder with a dynamic feature id folder name we would be down to one folder and one file
  - 1 [featureId] x 1 [conceptId] = 1
- this looks much better but we have to keep in mind that for every additional path in the url

- we would need to have another level of nesting in our pages folder
- so `docs/feature1concept1/example1` perhaps will lead to another level of nesting
- and if you think about it every page in our documentation website will have the same page layout
- so can we not define one file that can **catch all the route** segments in the url ?
- we most definitely can and this is where the catch all routes feature of next router comes into picture

---

- now another use case i can think of for catch all routes is to pass filter parameters for a page
- let's assume we are building a real estate website as a user i want to view a list of all the houses listed for sale
- but i should also be able to filter the houses based on my budget to cater to that we can create a catch-all route where we have a route for
  - `/house`
  - and this would list all the houses
- but i can also enter `/house/100000/1000000`
- as my min and max budget the catch all route can extract these values and filter the list of houses which can then be displayed to the user

- one last thing i want to discuss in this video is that there is an optional catch-all route as well
- at the moment if we navigate to just `/docs` we see a 404 error page
- and this is taken care of by next js and we will talk more about it after a few videos
- but what i want to say here is that next js provides optional catch-all routes to help with the scenario
- all you have to do is back in vs code wrap the square brackets with another pair of square brackets
  - […params].js → [[…params]].js
- if you now go back to the browser you can see that the same catch-all routes page is rendered for just `/docs` as well
- now this is really helpful in our documentation site to render the home page for just `/docs`
