- in this video let's focus on fetching data
- on click of a button that is how to make a GET request with api routes
- for our examples, we are not going to set up a database as that would become a distraction in itself
- we're going to keep it very simple and maintain the data in memory
- so the data basically is lost if you restart the application
- but that shouldn't matter since our focus is primarily on creating api routes 
- now to respond to a GET request we need some data to begin with
- in the project root folder, i'm going to create a new folder `data` within the folder i'm going to create a new file called comments.js
- this file basically contains an array of comments for example user comments on a youtube video

---

- for step one we're going to create an api endpoint that serves these comments so in the api folder i'm going to create a new folder called comments
- within the folder i'm going to create a new file called index.js
- since this is an api route we export a default handler function which receives request and response as parameters
- so export default function handler, request response from this function we need to return a json of all the comments stored in the data folder

  ```jsx
  import { comments } from '../../../data/comments';

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json(comments);
  }
  ```

- if you now head to the browser and navigate to `/api/comments`, we should see the array of comments being returned
- our api works as expected now

---

- for step 2 let's create a page which loads this data on click of a button in the pages folder
- i'm going to create a new folder called comments 
- this is outside the api folder 
- within the folder i'm going to create a new file called index.js
- within this file we create our react component

  ```jsx
  import { useState } from 'react';
  function CommentsPage() {
    const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);

    const fetchComments = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/comments');
      const data = await response.json();
      setComments(data);
    };

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={fetchComments}>Load comments</button>
        {comments.map((comment) => {
          return (
            <div key={comment.id}>
              {comment.id}. {comment.text}
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </>
    );
  }

  export default CommentsPage;
  ```
